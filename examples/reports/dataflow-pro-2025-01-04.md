## Key Takeaways

### What They Do Well
- Dominating the enterprise segment with credibility and features
- Strong compliance story for regulated industries
- Excellent partnership ecosystem
- Professional, trust-building marketing

### What They're Missing
- Self-service option for smaller customers
- Transparent pricing for faster evaluation
- Simpler onboarding for basic use cases
- Modern, user-friendly UI (looks dated)

### Competitive Differentiation
- **vs. Zapier/Make.com:** Enterprise-grade security, scalability, governance

### Opportunities for Your Product

2. **Transparent pricing** - Self-serve pricing beats "contact sales" for smaller buyers
3. **Faster time-to-value** - 1-week onboarding vs 3-month implementation
4. **Modern UI/UX** - Easier to use = lower training costs
