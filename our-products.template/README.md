# Product Documentation Templates

This directory contains templates to help you document your own product(s) for competitive research.

## How to Use

1. **Copy the template file:**
   ```bash
   cp our-products.template/your-product.template.md our-products/your-actual-product-name.md
   ```

2. **Fill in all the `{PLACEHOLDER}` values** with your actual product details

3. **Delete the template notice block** at the top when done

4. **Create additional product files** if you have multiple products to research

## Why Document Your Product?

Having detailed documentation of your own product helps:
- ✅ **Better competitive comparisons** - Know exactly what you offer vs. competitors
- ✅ **Identify gaps** - See where competitors have features you don't
- ✅ **Find opportunities** - Spot areas where you're stronger
- ✅ **Consistent messaging** - Reference your value props during research
- ✅ **Team alignment** - Everyone researching uses the same product understanding

## What to Include

Focus on information that's relevant for competitive analysis:
- **Pricing** - Critical for comparison
- **Key features** - What you do and don't have
- **Target market** - Who you compete for
- **Differentiators** - What makes you unique
- **Competitive positioning** - How you position against others

## Example Structure

After customizing, your `our-products/` directory should look like:
```
our-products/
├── README.md (optional - explain your products)
├── main-product.md
└── secondary-product.md (if applicable)
```
